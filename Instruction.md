Biolector Data Analysis

-Before you start, you have to adapt the path and experiment IDs at the top of the code:
	-adapt "setwd" -> specify the folder, where your data and layout file exist
	-adapt "cfile" -> specify the path including your calibration file
	-adapt "Parameters" -> specify the path including your Parameters file
	-adapt "expID" -> specify the ID of the experiment (name of the data file)
	-adapt "calID" -> specify the ID of the calibration from your calibrations.csv file you want to use

	Now run the preparation and the analysis block. Done.
