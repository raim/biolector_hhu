# Automating BioLector Data Analysis

The ZIEL is to write an R script that allows to analyze
growth experiments pipetted with the Opentron pipetting robot
and run in the BioLector or Clariostar platereaders 
with **minimal user intervention**.

Required data:

* Data exported from BioLector software (either raw or reduced),
* Microplate layout file,
* Media recipe,
* Physico-chemical constants.
